# msgraph-solid

This is a placeholder for a facility to allow [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) users who also use Microsoft existing apps
to get access to their Microsoft App data automatically through the *Microsoft Graph*
API.

Possible products we could develop here include

- A utility to do a one-time import of MSGRaph data into your solid pod
- A virtual read-only pod server which automatically contains all your Microsoft app data in solid format using the MS Graph APi in real time every query
- A utility to sync data both ways between MS Graph and Solid worlds

etc
